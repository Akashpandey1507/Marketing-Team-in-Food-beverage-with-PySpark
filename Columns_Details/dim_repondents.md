# It appears that you've provided a table with Respondent_IDs, names, age groups, genders, and City_IDs. Let's break down the information:

* **Respondent_ID:** Each respondent has a unique identification number, such as 120031, 120032, and so on. This ID is used to uniquely identify each person participating in a survey or study.
* **Name:** The names of the respondents are listed, such as "Aniruddh Issac," "Trisha Rout," "Yuvraj Virk," and so on. These are the names of the individuals providing responses in the survey.
* **Age:** The age groups of the respondents are categorized into different ranges, such as "15-18," "19-30," "31-45," "46-65," and "65+." This information provides insights into the age distribution of the survey participants.
* **Gender:** The gender of each respondent is specified as either "Male" or "Female." Gender is an important demographic variable used in surveys to analyze responses based on gender differences.
* **City_ID:** Each respondent is associated with a City_ID, such as "CT117," "CT118," "CT116," and so on. These City_IDs likely represent the locations or cities where the respondents reside. They can be used for geographical analysis or segmentation.
