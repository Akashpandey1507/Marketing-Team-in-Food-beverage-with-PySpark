# It appears you've provided a table with City_IDs, City names, and Tier classifications. Let's break down the information:

* **City_ID:** Each city is assigned a unique City_ID, such as CT111, CT112, CT113, and so on. These IDs are used to uniquely identify each city in the dataset.
* **City:** The "City" column contains the names of various cities in India, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Jaipur, and Lucknow. These are major cities located across different regions of the country.
* **Tier:** The "Tier" column indicates the tier classification of each city. In India, cities are often categorized into different tiers based on various factors, including population size, economic development, infrastructure, and overall urbanization. The tier classification is commonly used in marketing and business strategies to target specific markets and demographics.



* **"Tier 1"** cities typically represent major metropolitan areas with the highest level of economic development, infrastructure, and urbanization. Examples in this dataset include Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai.
* **"Tier 2"** cities are also urban centers but may be somewhat smaller or less developed compared to Tier 1 cities. Examples in this dataset include Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Jaipur, and Lucknow.
